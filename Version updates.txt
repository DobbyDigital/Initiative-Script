v3.1: Pin [Steven]
	-After much chagrin, pin functionality has been added, which allows the stats of a creature to be visible on the main window of the inititive GUI. Currently, the window auto-adjusts for only
	one pin. More pins can be added, but window size must be adjusted manually. There is also currently no way to remove a pin (since that part of the code wasn't working yet).  Adding a pin
	correctly updates the flag for the popup stats, so there shouldn't be a pop up to display the creature's stats on their turn.
	-Added a setting to determine the order that creatures appear on pop out GUIs.
	-Fixed a bug when adding a creature without using bestiary info.

v3.0.1: Small updates [Steven]
	-Healing functionality has been added, which includes temporary hit points.
	-Repeated stat GUI popups have been eliminated.
	-Added display for Turn Count to keep track of duration of combat.

v3.0: Preliminary GUI [Steven]
   - Basic Initiative GUI is now functional. Allows for adding and individual creature, adding a group of minions, adding a preset (with associated settings), damaging    creatures, removing creatures, and printing stats for monsters. Bestiary functionality is available. 
   - Functionality to be added: healing, effects(?), notes(?), lair effects, more try-catching...
   - Many aesthethic changes can (and should) be done: preventing repeated stat GUI popups, improving spacing, add colouring to improve clarity and readability, 
   reorganising the buttons on the main window, filling extra space in main window....

v2.2.2: Minor tweaks
   - 'add' function now allows you to add one of the presets to the initiative (so monsters can be entered into initiative first). Note that this will reset current
    player initiatives if they are already in the initiative order.
   - 'damage' function now checks if healing brings a monster above the max HP, and lowers the healing accordingly.
   - Made columns looks prettier when it displays the initiative.
v2.2.1: Preparatory damage option change + minor tweaks [Jeff]
   - Added vulnerability (v), resistance (r), thresholds (t) and healing (h) to the Damage option
   - Damage can now be rolled (e.g. 2d6 is a valid input)
   - Creatures' current HP now includes a percentage to quickly estimate relative survival and HP-dependent combat options
   - Section to track changes we'd like to make to the script in future (0.2)
   - Expanded options for campaign/preset reference
   - "Lair" option for terrain, environment or initiative count effects (also allows for having multiple lair events added at once)

v2.2: Bestiary fixes and notes [Steven and Jeff]
   - Fixed bestiary isseus that caused certain properties not to load correctly. Also added character detection to replace weird html characters.
   - Added 'notes' function to easily add or delete a note for a creature. The notes appear on the bottom during the creature's turn.
   - Added a check for CurrentTurn to make sure Jeff stops breaking the code.... I mean so that you can't damage or remove creatures before starting the turn tracker.

v2.1: Bestiary and Effects[Steven and Jeff]
   - Can now load monster info from HTML files into a Bestiary dictionary. This automatically inputs the dexterity modifier
     for the creature, as well as displays the traits and actions that creature can take during its turn.
   - Added 'AddBestiary' (in a separate file. Based on existing code by Jeff) to extract
     relevant info from HTML files and organise it into a dictionary.  In the same file is the 'PrintStats' function,
     that displays the stats, traits, and actions for the creature.
     Note: the 'AddBestiary' function does not load all info correctly. In particular, immunities are not loaded correctly.
           Will (probably) be fixed later.
   - Can also enter effects for creatures, including description, duration (with auto-updating turn counter, or normal text)
   - Added 'AddEffect', 'RemoveEffect', and 'PrintEffects' functions, which do obvious things ;)

v2.0.1: Bug fixes [Steven]
   - Corrected names.
   - Damage now appears immediately (instead of next round/ next Combatant list update)
   - Added functionality for 'Remove' function to allow for removing multiple enemies simultaneously.

v2.0: Data restructuring [Steven, with help from Jeff]
   - Massive overhaul of code to change the base data structures into a dictionary instead of a list. Modifications were made to
     almost every function to accomodate the change (including InitiativeRoll, DisplayInitiative, UpdateLog, Presets section, 
     remove, next, add, minions, and damage). Added new functions Initialise (creates Combatants list from base dictionary), 
     AddToInitiative (adds creature to Combatants list and adjusts turn count if necessary), and Remove (removes creature from 
     initiative and adjusts turn count if necessary).
   - 'Remove' function (in the Initiative part of the code) now adjusts turn count properly.
   - Initiative display now indicates maximum HP of monsters (for descriptive purposes).
   - Added 'turn' function to say who's turn it currently is (without updating turn count).
   - Code now asks if you want to use a preset (which have been programmed in for us) right at the start. Consequently the 
     initiative part of the script has been set to run when you start the script.
   - Code clean up: removed antiquated functions and branches, cleaned up ordering for some inputs (to reduce repeated code),
    changed some functions to recognise blank inputs (for [likely] default options), removed lair actions that were 
    included by default (can be added using 'Add' function [set to player]), removed file path in log, clarified some text
    (e.g. names for minions not needing to be Roll20 colours). That might be it, but there's probably other stuff too.

v1.6: Basic tracking [Steven]
   - Added basic turn-based tracking and printing
   -'Next' function now behaves differently depending on if it's the end of the round or not
   - Changed 'Add' and 'Minion' functions to sort combat order when they are added, and modify current turn count if needed

v1.5.2: Bug fixes [Steven]
   - Secondary sort for initiative ties now works correctly
   - Keyword combatants now asks for initiative rolls if the length is less than 4, instead of simply 'not equal 4'
   - Minor aesthetic fixes 

v1.5.1: Presets and minor fixes [Steven]
   - Added code for using preset options (as keyword parameter 'Combatants')
   - Log now includes non-player HP values
   - Fixed the missing '\n' that was bugging me in the options ;)

v1.4.7: Fixes and random HP [Steven]
   - 'Damage' function will now work regardless of capitalisation.
   - 'Next' function now adds a secondary sort for First-Time initiative.
   - Added 'HPCalc' function to input random HP for creatures (using 'Add' or 'Minions'). 
     Includes the option for a minimum HP.


v1.4.6: Timesave [Steven]
   - Added 'Minions' option to add a bunch of identical monsters to the initiative. Names are generated automatically using Roll20 colours and numbers.
     HP values can be inputted separately for each monster.

v1.4.5: quick update [Jeff]
   - Removal can now be done either by matching a substrict or matching the whole string

v1.4.4: quick update [Jeff]
   - Change to the 'Roll' function to compute (dis)adv internally and to output the value

v1.4.3: Some updates [Steven]
   - 'Damage' option asks to remove combatants individually instead of removing all non-positive HP values
   - Auto-kill option modified
   - Options displayed at beginning are now in alphabetical order (yes, it WAS bugging me that you put "roll" in the middle)

   - Optional autoremoval for death ('kill')
   - Functions: Adv, Disadv, Roll
